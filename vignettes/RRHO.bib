	title = {A Practitioner's Guide to Multiple Testing Error Rates},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4920},
	abstract = {It is quite common in modern research, for a researcher to test many hypotheses. The statistical (frequentist) hypothesis testing framework, does not scale with the number of hypotheses in the sense that naively performing many hypothesis tests will probably yield many false findings. Indeed, statistical "significance" is evidence for the presence of a signal within the noise expected in a single test, not in a multitude. In order to protect himself from an uncontrolled number of erroneous findings, a researcher has to consider of the type or errors he wishes to avoid and select the adequate procedure for that particular error type and data structure. A quick search of the tag [multiple-comparisons] in the statistics Questions \& Answers web site Cross Validates (http://stats.stackexchange.com) demonstrates the amount of confusion this task can actually cause. This was also a point made at the 2009 Multiple Comparisons conference in Tokyo. In an attempt to offer guidance, we review possible error types for multiple testing, and demonstrate them with some practical examples, which clarify the formalism. Finally, we include some notes on the software implementations of the methods discussed. The emphasis of this manuscript is on the error-rates, and not on the procedures themselves. We do try to name several procedures in this manuscript where appropriate. P-value adjustment will not be discussed as it is procedure specific. I.e., it is the choice of a procedure that defines the p-value adjustment, and not the error rate itself. Simultaneous confidence intervals will, also, not be discussed.},

	volume = {38},

	shorttitle = {Rank{\textendash}rank hypergeometric overlap},
	abstract = {Comparing independent high-throughput gene-expression experiments can generate hypotheses about which gene-expression programs are shared between particular biological processes. Current techniques to compare expression profiles typically involve choosing a fixed differential expression threshold to summarize results, potentially reducing sensitivity to small but concordant changes. We present a threshold-free algorithm called Rank{\textendash}rank Hypergeometric Overlap ({RRHO}). This algorithm steps through two gene lists ranked by the degree of differential expression observed in two profiling experiments, successively measuring the statistical significance of the number of overlapping genes. The output is a graphical map that shows the strength, pattern and bounds of correlation between two expression profiles. To demonstrate {RRHO} sensitivity and dynamic range, we identified shared expression networks in cancer microarray profiles driving tumor progression, stem cell properties and response to targeted kinase inhibition. We demonstrate how {RRHO} can be used to determine which model system or drug treatment best reflects a particular biological or disease response. The threshold-free and graphical aspects of {RRHO} complement other rank-based approaches such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}), for which {RRHO} is a 2D analog. Rank{\textendash}rank overlap analysis is a sensitive, robust and web-accessible method for detecting and visualizing overlap trends between two complete, continuous gene-expression profiles. A web-based implementation of {RRHO} can be accessed at http://systems.crump.ucla.edu/rankrank/.},
